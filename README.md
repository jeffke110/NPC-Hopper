This is a simple jump game with a 400x400 canvas
The 3 Npc's avoid the balls that will spawn in the bottom stair case
Every time the space bar is pressed a ball will drop from the top left corner of the canvas
If a Npc is hit, it dies and disappears.
If all Npcs die, the player wins.
If an Npc reaches the 2nd most top stair without getting hit, the player loses
The player can press enter to play again.
Controls: 
Space bar: drop ball from top left corner
Enter: replay the game
